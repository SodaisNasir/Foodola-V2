<h3>cookies </h3>

<p>Our website uses cookies. These are small text files that your web browser stores on your end device. Cookies help us to make our offer more user-friendly, effective and secure. 

Some cookies are “session cookies.” Such cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your browser session. On the other hand, other cookies remain on your end device until you delete them yourself. Such cookies help us to recognize you when you return to our website. 

With a modern web browser you can monitor, restrict or prevent the setting of cookies. Many web browsers can be configured in such a way that cookies are automatically deleted when the program is closed. The deactivation of cookies can result in limited functionality of our website. 

The setting of cookies, which are necessary to carry out electronic communication processes or to provide certain functions you want (e.g. shopping cart), takes place on the basis of Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f GDPR. As the operator of this website, we have a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies for the technically error-free and smooth provision of our services. If other cookies are set (e.g. for analysis functions), they will be treated separately in this data protection declaration. </p>

<h3>Google Analytics </h3>
<p>Our website uses functions of the web analysis service Google Analytics. The provider of the web analysis service is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. 

Google Analytics uses "cookies." These are small text files that your web browser stores on your end device and enable analysis of website usage. Information generated by cookies about your use of our website is transmitted to a Google server and stored there. Server location is usually the USA. 

Google Analytics cookies are set on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. As the operator of this website, we have a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize our website and, if necessary, advertising. 

IP anonymization 

We use Google Analytics in connection with the IP anonymization function. It ensures that Google shortens your IP address within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area before it is transmitted to the USA. There may be exceptional cases in which Google transmits the full IP address to a server in the USA and shortens it there. On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to create reports on website activity and to provide us with other services related to website activity and internet usage. The IP address transmitted by Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. 

browser plug-in 

The setting of cookies by your web browser can be prevented. However, this could limit some functions of our website. You can also prevent the collection of data relating to your website use, including your IP address and subsequent processing by Google. This is possible by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de . 

Objection to data collection 

You can prevent Google Analytics from collecting your data by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent your data from being collected on future visits to our website: Disable Google Analytics. 

For details on how Google Analytics handles user data, see Google's privacy policy: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de . 

order processing 

In order to fully comply with the legal data protection requirements, we have concluded an order processing contract with Google. 

Demographic characteristics in Google Analytics 

Our website uses the "demographic characteristics" function of Google Analytics. It can be used to create reports that contain statements about the age, gender and interests of the site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising from Google and visitor data from third-party providers. It is not possible to assign the data to a specific person. You can deactivate this function at any time. This is possible via the ad settings in your Google account or by generally prohibiting the collection of your data by Google Analytics, as explained in the point "Objection to data collection".

Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking 

Our website uses Google AdWords. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. 

AdWords is an online advertising program. As part of the online advertising program, we work with conversion tracking. After clicking on an ad placed by Google, a cookie is set for conversion tracking. Cookies are small text files that your web browser stores on your end device. Google AdWords cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used to personally identify users. We and Google can use the cookie to recognize that you have clicked on an ad and were forwarded to our website. 

Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. The cookies are not traceable across AdWords advertiser websites. Conversion cookies are used to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who use conversion tracking. Adwords customers find out how many users clicked on their ad and were redirected to pages with a conversion tracking tag. However, AdWords customers do not receive any information that would allow users to be personally identified. If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can object to its use. Here the conversion cookie must be deactivated in the user settings of the browser. This means that there is no inclusion in the conversion tracking statistics. 

"Conversion cookies" are stored on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. As the website operator, we have a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize our website and our advertising. 

Details on Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking can be found in Google's data protection regulations: https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/ .
